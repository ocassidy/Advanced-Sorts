an introduction to auctions

there are basically two types of auctions ascending-bid auctions and descending-bid auctions 
ascending-bid auctions start out with a low bid for an object the price of the object is gradually 
raised until only one bidder remains by contrast descending-bid auctions start out with a high bid 
and the price is progressively lowered until a customer expresses a willingness to purchase the object
both procedures have a number of variants for example in some types of auctions a professional 
auctioneer declares the suggested bids in other types of auctions however the customers make their 
own bids another variant used at places such as ebay or yahoo auction is called a buyout option 
a high price for an item is declared anyone willing to pay that price is guaranteed a purchase 
this variant seems to appeal consumers who dislike uncertainty for a fixed price they are guaranteed an object 
buyout options are most commonly used if the seller has a stock of several copies of the same item 

both ascending-bid and descending-bid auctions can be conducted in either open or closed formats in open formats 
all participants know what exactly how much an object is going for for example at many japanese fish markets
wholesalers gather around the fish to be purchased and raise their hands as the auctioneer names progressively 
higher prices in closed auctions participants are unaware of how much other participants are willing to pay 
for an object for example a case in which participants used sealed envelopes to place their bids on a piece of 
real estate represents this type of auction though open auctions generally yield higher prices closed formats are 
sometimes preferred in situations in which the privacy of the prospective buyers is considered paramount or the need 
to document precisely how much each party bid is high the bidder with best offer wins thus favouring those who can 
estimate the value of the item under auction
